# ShouldI? — Comic Decision Assistant

**ShouldI?** is a comic-style decision assistant that helps users think clearly at life’s crossroads.  
It breaks down complex dilemmas into visual panels, explores realistic paths, highlights trade-offs, and delivers a grounded recommendation with a confidence score.

The goal isn’t to tell users what to do — it’s to help them *see the decision*.
